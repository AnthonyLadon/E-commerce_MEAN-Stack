# Easy Shopping (Fake webstite)

This is a personnal project witch I'm developping to train myself on the MEAN stack.
I'm using a free public API that provides fake products (images, prices, descriptions...)

In the future I will create my own Rest API with more specific products.

## Technology used

- Angular
- Node.JS (With Nodemon)
- MongoDB / Mongoose
- Express
- Taillwind
- Fontawesome

I've chosen to not using Material or PrimeNg because I wanted to learn how to handle Taillwind (& I'm enjoyning this librairie)
