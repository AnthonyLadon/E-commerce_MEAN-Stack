# Easy Shopping (Fake Shopping app)

This is a personnal project wich I'm developping to train myself on the MEAN stack.
I'm using a free public API that provides fake products (images, prices, descriptions...) but I'm planning to create my own Rest API with more specific products to get a better control on the data and add more features.

## You can follow the project on the following link

## Technology used

- Frontend:

  - Angular
  - TailwindCSS
  - Fontawesome

- Backend:
  - Node.JS
  - Nodemon
  - Express
  - MongoDB
  - Mongoose

I've chosen to not using Material or PrimeNg to force myself to get to know better Taillwind.

### In the future, I plan to:

- Create a custom REST API with more specific products.
- Implement additional features such as user authentication, shopping cart functionality, multi language.

Your contributions and feedback are welcome!
